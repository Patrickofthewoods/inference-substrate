Inference Substrate
A minimal, parity-driven simulation toolkit for rare-event transitions — verified against real physics, not just simulated in isolation.

What this repo actually does
Two things, both verified and reproducible:

A parity-based collapse model. For a chain of independent rare-event transitions, whether the system ends in a different state than it started depends only on the parity (odd/even count) of successful transitions. This repo simulates that directly and checks it against the closed-form analytic prediction — they match.

A physics-grounded benchmark (Kramers vs. Langevin). The parity model requires a transition probability k. Instead of assuming one, this benchmark derives k from an actual physical system — a symmetric double-well potential — using Kramers' escape-rate theory, then checks the resulting prediction against a full numerical simulation of the underlying Langevin dynamics. The results agree, within the known and explained bounds of transition-state theory.

If you just want to see it work, run:

python kramers_vs_langevin_benchmark.py

Overview
The Inference Substrate is a compact simulation engine built to explore how parity-based collapse laws emerge from simple, independent rare-event transitions. It provides a clean, reproducible implementation of the core parity model, along with a physical validation of it.

This repository contains:

A full chain simulation (step-by-step transitions, parity collapse detection)

A minimal parity demonstration (Appendix A version)

A physics-grounded escape-rate benchmark (Kramers vs. Langevin)

A conceptual manuscript sketching possible extensions beyond physics

A permanent noncommercial license protecting commercial use

A simple, readable codebase intended for research, teaching, and exploration

The project is released once, in full, and is not intended for ongoing maintenance.

Benchmark Suite Overview
The benchmark suite evaluates how the minimal inference substrate behaves across a wide range of dynamical regimes. Each benchmark isolates a specific phenomenon and tests whether the substrate’s collapse structure, parity behavior, or noise-driven inference dynamics remain consistent.

Parity Benchmarks
markov_chain_parity_benchmark.py — Tests parity structure in discrete Markov transitions.

parity_plot_overlay.py — Minimal Appendix A parity demonstration.

Physics Benchmarks
kramers_vs_langevin_benchmark.py — Compares Kramers escape predictions to Langevin dynamics.

poisson_vs_langevin.py — Tests Poisson collapse vs continuous Langevin noise.

triple_well_langevin_benchmark.py — Multi-well metastability benchmark.

CTMC Benchmarks
ctmc_two_state_benchmark.py — Two-state exponential waiting-time benchmark.

Decision Threshold Benchmarks
decision_threshold_benchmark1.py — Basic threshold-crossing dynamics.

decision_threshold_benchmark2.py — Extended threshold behavior under noise.

Multi-Agent Benchmarks
multi_agent_agentcount_sweep.py — Scaling behavior with agent count.

multi_agent_asymmetry_sweep.py — Asymmetric coupling effects.

multi_agent_coupling_sweep.py — Phase transitions under coupling strength.

multi_agent_langevin_benchmark.py — Multi-agent Langevin substrate behavior.

multi_agent_noise_sweep.py — Noise sensitivity and stability.

Usage
Kramers vs. Langevin Benchmark (Escape-Rate Validation)
Run:

python benchmarks/physics/kramers_vs_langevin_benchmark.py

This produces escape-rate comparisons between:

Kramers/TST prediction

empirical barrier-crossing

empirical far-well commitment

The Kramers/TST prediction lies between the two empirical measures, as expected from metastable escape theory.

About the Manuscript
Manuscript.pdf develops the parity/collapse model in detail and derives its physical embedding. Later sections explore conceptual extensions beyond physics; these are hypotheses, not validated results.
